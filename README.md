# ETL Mini-Project: Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview
The **ETL Mini-Project** focuses on developing an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline. You'll automate the process of extracting raw data from a source, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a database for analysis.

## Objectives
1. **Extract**:
   - Retrieve raw data from CSV files, APIs, or other sources.

2. **Transform**:
   - Clean, organize, and process the data to prepare it for analysis.
   - Handle missing values, convert data types, and normalize formats.

3. **Load**:
   - Store the transformed data in a database, such as PostgreSQL or SQLite.

4. **Analysis and Insights**:
   - Query the database to extract insights from the cleaned and processed data.

## Deliverables
- Python scripts implementing the ETL pipeline.
- A database populated with the transformed data.
- Documentation of the ETL process and insights derived from the data.

## Usage
1. Run the Python scripts to automate the ETL process.
2. Query the database to verify data storage and retrieve insights.
